The Bureau: XCOM Declassified PhysXCore.dll Fix

Description
This PowerShell script fixes an issue with The Bureau: XCOM Declassified where the PhysXCore.dll file needs to be updated to the latest version available on the system. If this is not done, the game will crash.

Requirements
1. NVIDIA drivers installed with PhysX support.
2. The Bureau: XCOM Declassified installed (well duh! ðŸ˜‰).

If you are not using the Steam version of the game or you installed it to a non-default location, you will need to update the $GamePath in the script.
